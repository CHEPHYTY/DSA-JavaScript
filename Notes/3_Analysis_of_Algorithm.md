# Analysis of Algorithms

- An Algorithms is a set instructions to perform a task ot to solve a given problem.
- There are several different algorithms to solve a given problem.
- Analysis of algorithm deals in finding best algorithm which runs fast and takes in less memory

## To check the efficiency of the algorithm we study Time Complexity and Space Complexity.
